## Web-Tier-GCP
* We have built an elastic web application using PaaS. We have used the PaaS resource of Google Compute Engine that is Google App Engine. This web application (Medicine Expiry Reminder) will help users to remind them about the expiry date of the medicine. Taking the scenario, no one can buy the medicine without a doctor&#39;s prescription. Doctor needs to fill prescriptions that will be transferred to the desired pharmacy company of the users, and every bill that is generated has some kind of barcode or QR code. Now, our system needs certain information such as Medicine name, expiry date, doctor’s name, doctor’s email id, manufacturer of the medicine. So, we proposed a solution that above mentioned information can be easily stored in some form such as QR code or Barcode of the bill. Users just need to scan QR code or Barcode and all the reminders will be set in the google calendar of the users.
